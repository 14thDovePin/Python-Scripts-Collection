# Developer Note
This repository is the collection of scripts I have made for my personal use cases. This collection is also meant to be a repository to showcase my skills in improving tedious computer tasks in gaming, workflows, computer hobbies, or just with the everyday use of a typical Windows system.

Each script should have a folder of its own and a `main.py` file to execute it. File names should only vary in special circumstances.  Inside every `main.py` should also be the description of *what* the script is for and *why* the script was made. Coding conventions of my knowledge will apply and overtime will improve as I gain more experience.

That's all!
